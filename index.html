        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser is a sturdy and stylish
          platform that elevates your screen to a more comfortable viewing
          height. Placing your monitor at eye level has the potential to improve 
          your posture and make you more comfortable while at work, helping
          you stay focused on the task at hand.<br>
          Featuring artisan craftsmanship,the simplicity of design creates extra
          desk space below your computer to allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks
          to be stored under the stand.
